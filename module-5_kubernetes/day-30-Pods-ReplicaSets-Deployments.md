# Day 30	Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments

Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments" is one of the most important topic in Kubernetes. Iâ€™ll explain it step by step with a hands-on demo.

### ðŸ“Œ Explanation with Hands-On Example
### 1. Pods
 - A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
 - It can run one or more containers.
 - Think of it as a wrapper around containers.
ðŸ‘‰ Example Pod YAML (pod.yaml):
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: proxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80
        name: http-web-svc

```
Run:
```sh
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod mypod
```

### 2. Service
 - A Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. It provides a stable IP address and DNS name for a group of Pods, enabling network access and load balancing among them.
ðŸ‘‰ Example Service YAML (service.yaml):
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: proxy
  ports:
  - name: name-of-service-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    nodePort: 30091
  type: NodePort
```

### 3. ReplicaSets
 - Ensures a specified number of Pods are always running.
 - If a Pod crashes, ReplicaSet creates a new one automatically.
ðŸ‘‰ Example ReplicaSet YAML (replicaset.yaml):

```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: proxy
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: proxy
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: proxy
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:stable
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
            name: http-web-svc
```
Run:
```sh
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods
```
ðŸ‘‰ Youâ€™ll see 2 Pods running.

### 4. Deployments
 - A Deployment manages ReplicaSets.
 - Provides rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling.
 - This is what we usually use in production.
ðŸ‘‰ Example Deployment YAML (deployment.yaml)
```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: proxy
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: proxy
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: proxy
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:stable
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
            name: http-web-svc
```
Run:
```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
```
ðŸ‘‰ Update Deployment:
```sh
kubectl set image deployment/mydeployment nginx-container=nginx:1.23
kubectl rollout status deployment/mydeployment
```
ðŸ‘‰ Rollback:
```sh
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mydeployment
```
