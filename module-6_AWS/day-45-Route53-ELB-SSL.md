# Day-45: Route53, ELB, SSL

### Hands-on Demo: AWS Route 53 + ELB + SSL
Architecture Overview
 - Deploy an EC2 (or ECS service) with a sample web app.
 - Put the app behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
 - Use Route 53 to map a custom domain to the ALB.
 - Enable SSL certificate (HTTPS) using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

### Step 1: Create a Sample Web App on EC2
```sh
sudo yum install -y httpd
echo "Hello from AWS with HTTPS" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```
âœ… App runs on port 80.

### Step 2: Create Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  1. Go to EC2 â†’ Load Balancers â†’ Create Load Balancer â†’ Application Load Balancer.
  2. Choose Internet-facing, HTTP/HTTPS.
  3. Add your EC2 instance(s) to a Target Group.
  4. Confirm: Access ALB DNS (e.g., http://my-alb-123456.elb.amazonaws.com).

### Step 3: Get a Free SSL Certificate
  1. Go to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
  2. Request a certificate for your domain (e.g., example.com, www.example.com).
  3. Validate domain ownership via DNS (Route 53 makes it 1-click).

### Step 4: Attach SSL to ALB
  1. Edit ALB Listeners â†’ Add HTTPS (port 443).
  2. Select the SSL certificate from ACM.
  3. Forward traffic to your Target Group (EC2 app).
âœ… Now your app works on https://my-alb-123456.elb.amazonaws.com

### Step 5: Configure Route 53
  1. Buy or transfer a domain to Route 53 (e.g., myawsdemo.com).
  2. Create a Hosted Zone.
  3. Create a Record Set:
     - Type: A (Alias)
     - Alias Target: Your ALB DNS name
     âœ… Now your domain (https://myawsdemo.com) points to ALB with SSL.


### Step 6: Test
 - Open browser â†’ https://myawsdemo.com
 - Confirm ðŸ”’ Secure (SSL) and load balancing works.
