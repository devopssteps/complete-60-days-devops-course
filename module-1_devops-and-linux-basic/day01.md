## ✅ Day 01: What is DevOps? SDLC vs DevOps, CI/CD Concepts

## 🔹 What is DevOps?
DevOps is a combination of:
 - Dev = Development (coding, building features)
 - Ops = Operations (deploying, monitoring, infrastructure)

Definition: DevOps is a cultural and technical approach that aims to integrate software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the software development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality.

### 🔸 Real-World Example:
Imagine you're building a web app:
 - Developer writes code.
 - Ops team deploys the app to a server.

In traditional setup, there’s delay, miscommunication. <br>
In DevOps:
 - Developer and Ops work together
 - Use automation tools (like Jenkins, Docker, GitHub Actions)
 - Deploy in minutes instead of days.


## 🔹 SDLC vs DevOps
| Feature            | Traditional SDLC             | DevOps                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Process            | Sequential (Waterfall/Agile) | Continuous (CI/CD pipeline)          |
| Team Collaboration | Dev and Ops are **separate** | Dev and Ops work **together**        |
| Delivery           | Slow and manual              | Fast and automated                   |
| Feedback           | Late                         | Continuous and real-time             |
| Tools              | Manual testing, scripting    | CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform |

### 🔸 Diagram Explanation:
🟡 Traditional SDLC (Waterfall):
```sh
Planning → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
(Each phase done one by one)
```
🟢 DevOps Cycle:
```sh
PLAN → DEVELOP → BUILD → TEST → RELEASE → DEPLOY → OPERATE → MONITOR
    ^                                                           |
    └─────────────────── Continuous Feedback ───────────────────┘
```

### 🔹 What is CI/CD?
| Term   | Full Form                        | Description                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **CI** | Continuous Integration           | Automatically testing and merging code           |
| **CD** | Continuous Delivery / Deployment | Automatically delivering or deploying to servers |

### 🔸 Example Workflow:
 1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
 2. Jenkins triggers a pipeline:
    - Builds the app
    - Runs tests
    - If passed, deploys to a server
 ```sh
# Step 1: Developer writes code
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Step 2: Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Step 3: Jenkins auto-builds and deploys
```

### 🧠 Pro Tips to Remember
 - DevOps is not a tool, it’s a culture + automation
 - CI = testing + building on each commit
 - CD = deploying automatically or semi-automatically
 - Aim = faster releases, fewer bugs, happy users

### ✅ DevOps Tools Overview
| Stage        | Tool                     | Purpose                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Plan         | Jira, Trello             | Project and issue tracking                |
| Develop      | Git, GitHub, GitLab      | Source code management                    |
| Build        | Maven, Gradle, npm       | Build automation                          |
| CI/CD        | Jenkins, GitHub Actions  | Automate testing, integration, deployment |
| Test         | Selenium, JUnit, PHPUnit | Automated testing                         |
| Deploy       | Ansible, Terraform       | Deploy infrastructure                     |
| Containerize | Docker                   | Containerize applications                 |
| Orchestrate  | Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS) | Manage containers at scale                |
| Monitor      | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK | Log and performance monitoring            |
| Alert        | Alertmanager, PagerDuty  | Incident management                       |


### ✅ Real-Time Workflow Example
Scenario: Deploy a Node.js App using DevOps
 - 👨‍💻 Developer pushes code to GitHub
 - ⚙️ Jenkins detects the push via webhook, runs pipeline:
    - Pulls code
    - Runs unit tests (with Mocha or Jest)
    - Builds Docker image
    - Pushes image to Docker Hub
- 🌐 Ansible connects to EC2 or prepares Kubernetes manifests
- 🌐 Terraform connects to craete EC2 by code
- 🐳 Docker runs containers
- ☸️ Kubernetes (EKS) deploys updated containers
- 📊 Prometheus + Grafana monitor CPU, memory, and response time
- 🔔 Alertmanager sends Slack alert if issues detected
