## DevOps Tools Overview & Real-Time Workflow

### ✅ 1. What is DevOps? 
“DevOps is the combination of Development and Operations. It's all about automating the software delivery process so teams can build, test, and deploy applications faster and more reliably.”
Key Concepts:
 - Continuous Integration (CI)
 - Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
 - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 - Monitoring & Feedback

### ✅ 2. DevOps Lifecycle 
```sh
Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor
```

### ✅ 3. DevOps Tools Overview
| Stage        | Tool                     | Purpose                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Plan         | Jira, Trello             | Project and issue tracking                |
| Develop      | Git, GitHub, GitLab      | Source code management                    |
| Build        | Maven, Gradle, npm       | Build automation                          |
| CI/CD        | Jenkins, GitHub Actions  | Automate testing, integration, deployment |
| Test         | Selenium, JUnit, PHPUnit | Automated testing                         |
| Deploy       | Ansible, Terraform       | Deploy infrastructure                     |
| Containerize | Docker                   | Containerize applications                 |
| Orchestrate  | Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS) | Manage containers at scale                |
| Monitor      | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK | Log and performance monitoring            |
| Alert        | Alertmanager, PagerDuty  | Incident management                       |


### ✅ 4. Real-Time Workflow Example
Scenario: Deploy a Node.js App using DevOps
 - 👨‍💻 Developer pushes code to GitHub
 - ⚙️ Jenkins detects the push via webhook, runs pipeline:
    - Pulls code
    - Runs unit tests (with Mocha or Jest)
    - Builds Docker image
    - Pushes image to Docker Hub
- 🌐 Ansible connects to EC2 or prepares Kubernetes manifests
- 🐳 Docker runs containers
- ☸️ Kubernetes (EKS) deploys updated containers
- 📊 Prometheus + Grafana monitor CPU, memory, and response time
- 🔔 Alertmanager sends Slack alert if issues detected
